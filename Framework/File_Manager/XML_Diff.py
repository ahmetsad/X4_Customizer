Side note: Python xml libraries (lxml and ElementTree) xpath operations
are always with reference to the file root node, eg. "macros", which
is returned when loading or parsing an xml file.
X4 xpaths appears to have a virtual node above root; this is similar to
notepad++ xml plugin, where '/' selects a "doc" node above the file root.
Eg. in Python, to select "macros" style root, use '/', but in X4, 
use '/*[1]' or similar.

Inputs to these functions will use Python roots, and internally do
temporary super-root addition to handle operations in the X4 style.
(X4 style does notably allow for replacement of root.)

Note on patch generation approach:
    Handling of changes to attributes and text, if no nodes were
    added or removed, are straight forward.
    Node changes, however, rapidly become very complex to do well.

    For instance, if two nodes at the same depth have different
    children, then those child lists need to be matched up to
    determine which are the same subelement and which differ, but
    such comparisons get messy when a given subelement may be
    mostly the same but with a minor edit (eg. a nested attrib change).

    Getting a minimal patch from raw input xml is messy, and doesn't
    feel work doing.

    However, since the customizer had access to the original xml,
    and made the edits locally, it is possible to annotate all
    of the original nodes with a node_id, carry that into any
    modified copies, and then use node_id comparisons to guide
    the patching effort (knowing which nodes should be the same
    without worry about content differences).

    lxml uses low level elements that cannot have python attributes
    added, but they do off a 'sourceline' attribute that can be
    reused for this purpose.
    The original sourceline, filled during parsing, is not sufficient
    since multiple nodes could be declared on the same line.
    However, it can be overwritten with custom, unique node_id terms,
    and it will be carried through deepcopies into modified xml.

    To have uniqueness more globally, nodes can be tagged with
    their xml tree's object id along with a node offset, which
    should avoid confusion if comparing nodes that come from
    separate trees. Can use a tuple of (id(tree), node_index).

    Update: the sourcelines property has some funkiness going on
    when writing it (doing some <= comparison to an int), so it
    is unuseable for tuple writing.  Further, it does not allow
    values larger than an unsigned short (65k), nor does it
    allow values <= 0 (they get replaced with None).

    The only other halfway decent option is to overwrite the tail,
    which isn't expected to be in use for anything normally.
    In that case, printing will need to go through an intermediate
    function that clears out the tail id strings first.

    Update: when an lxml element is appended to using addnext(),
    it transfers its tail to the appended element, breaking node ids.
    TODO: think of a workaround. For now, disallow addnext().
    (TODO: think of how to disallow addnext.)

    Refining this further:
        When the original nodes are given ids, and those are copied
        into the modified tree (for nice matching), any new nodes
        added to the modified tree will be id-less.

        To enable running matches, as a copy of the original_tree is
        patched to be more like the modified_tree, these new nodes
        will need their own unique ids.

        To get this, can rely on the python id() values: set all
        original nodes to have their id() as their tag; since the
        original_tree will continue to be live in memory, those ids
        can never be reused. So just before patching, the modified_tree
        can be visited to find all new nodes with no id, and fill it
        in with their id(), ensured to be unique.

        Update: another funkiness of lxml: with iterating over nodes
        in a tree, they appear to have only temporary python objects
        assigned, and as such during iteration id() values can
        be repeated. There doesn't appear to be a great fix for this;
        short of keeping a list of every node assigned an id.

        Though if needing a static tracker based solution, just
        as easy (why wasn't this used sooner...) is to have a global
        running id counter, that is sure to assign unique integer
        ids across all calls to id filling function.

'''
'''
Note on lxml and xpath bugginess:
    When using indexed lookups (/a/b[5]), lxml tends to bog down
    horribly in larger files.  For the wares file, it was 1/1000 speed.

    Further, lxml evaluates expressions with a parameter and an index
    incorrectly when using find or findall.
    Example:
        /a/b[@c="d"][5]

        By the xpath docs, this should be the 5th child of 'a' that
        is of tag 'b' and has attribute 'c=d'.

        lxml gets this wrong, and looks for a child of 'a' that is
        the 5th child and also has attribue 'c=d'.

    In the python docs, buried toward the end of the xpath section,
    is this: "position predicates must be preceded by a tag name".
    lxml copies this behavior.

    However, lxml also has an 'xpath' method that will act like findall
    except with correct evaluation. Use that always.
'''
'''
Note on namespaces:
    In short, they are a mess.
    Original xml uses namespace prefixes on eg. attribute names, eg. "xsi:bla".
    Lxml replaces these with the namespace base, eg. "{stuff}bla".
    Xpath applied to original xml needs to use the prefixed version.
    Xpath applied to the lxml nodes needs to use the expanded version.

    For now, this code will mostly punt on namespaces, outside of changing
    basic attributes, eg. the schema path in the root node.
