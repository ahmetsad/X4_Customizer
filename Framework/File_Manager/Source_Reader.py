X4 virtual path determination:

    1 Any file in the base x4 catalogs will have a virtual path
      relative to the root x4 folder.
      Eg. '/libraries/parameters.xml'

    2 Extension files that have a path relative to the extension folder
      which matches the path of a base file relative to the x4 folder
      will use the x4 folder based path, and act as a patch (diff or append).
      Eg. '/extensions/extA/libraries/wares.xml' will use the path
          'libraries/wares.xml'

    3 Extensions files that do not match to a base file will instead
      use a path relative to the x4 base folder.
      Note: this is based on extension folder name, not extension id.
      Eg. '/extensions/extA/libraries/newfile.xml' will use the path
          '/extensions/extA/libraries/newfile.xml'

    4 Extensions which target other extensions' new files will have
      a path relative to the extension folder that matches a path
      relative to the base x4 folder, extended out to the other extension.
      Eg. 'extensions/extA/extensions/extB/somefile' will use the path
          'extensions/extB/somefile'.
      This comes up when extensions edit files from other extensions.
      It also comes up when there is no dependency in place, so extA
      can patch extB files without a dependency on extB.
      This is essentially the same as (1).
      

TODO: it has been suggested and md/aiscript folders in extensions will
always have a path relative to the base x4 folder, not the extension.
Run a test on this.

TODO: the readme for X:Rebirth tools says that anything in ext is
relative to the extension, anything in subst relative to x4 base.
Can maybe verify that here, though currently it is not expected to
change pathing logic.

TODO: version based extensions.


Loading order:

    After various testing, the x4 file loading order appears to be:
        
        a) Search for the base file version (not a patch).
            - This will establish the actual virtual_path of the file.
            - Paths not starting with 'extensions/' will look in the
              base x4 directory and the 'subst_#.cat' files of the
              extensions.
            - Paths starting with 'extensions/' will look only at the
              particular named extension, and will search inside it
              using a truncated path.

        b) Search for patches.
            - All extensions are searched, not the base game folders.
            - If the path starts with 'extensions', the particular
              named extension can be skipped (cannot patch its own file).
            - Path is left unmodified.
            - These can be found in 'ext_#.cat' or as loose files.
            - Does not include 'subst_#.cat' files; those were handled
              during base file loading.

    Priorities for loading will be determined separately per step.

    Eg. is extA has a dependency on extB and introduces file newfile.xml,
    and extB has a patch for newfile.xml, then the newfile.xml will load
    from exta (as part of step (a)), and then get patched by extB, even
    though that seems to be opposite the dependency order.

    For extensions that have no dependencies to order them, they will
    be handled in lowercase alphabetical folder order.

Note on case:
    To simplify path handling, all paths will be lower cased.
    A side effect is that extension names need to be stored in lower
    case, since they can show up in virtual paths.

    This appears to sync up with the game internals, particularly in
    regard to linux support (which requires extensions use lower case
    in general for paths). This can also be observed in the log,
    where listed extension names are sometimes printed in lower case
    (eg. signature checks are lower case, and though extension diff messages
    are original case, extensions are ordered alphabetically based
    on lower case).
