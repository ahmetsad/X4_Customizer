    '''
    This holds general settings and paths to control the customizer.
    Adjust these settings as needed prior to running the first plugin,
    using direct writes to attributes.

    Settings may be updated individually, or as arguments of
    a call to Settings, or through a "settings.json" file in the
    top X4 Customizer folder (eg. where documentation resides).
    Any json settings will overwrite defaults, and be overwritten by
    settings in the control script. Changes made using the GUI
    will be applied to the json settings.

    Examples:
    * In the control script (prefix paths with 'r' to support backslashes):
      <code>
          Settings.path_to_x4_folder   = r'C:\...'
          Settings.path_to_user_folder = r'C:\...'
          Settings(
               path_to_x4_folder   = r'C:\...',
               path_to_user_folder = r'C:\...'
               )
      </code>
    * In settings.json (sets defaults for all scripts):
      <code>
          {
            "path_to_x4_folder"        : "C:\...",
            "path_to_user_folder"      : "C:\...",
            "output_to_user_extensions": "true"
          }
      </code>

    Paths:
    * path_to_x4_folder
      - Path to the main x4 folder.
      - Defaults to HOMEDRIVE/"Steam/steamapps/common/X4 Foundations"
    * path_to_user_folder
      - Path to the folder where user files are located.
      - Should include config.xml, content.xml, etc.
      - Defaults to HOMEPATH/"Documents/Egosoft/X4" or a subfolder
        with an 8-digit name.
    * path_to_source_folder
      - Optional path to a source folder that holds high priority source
        files, which will be used instead of reading the x4 cat/dat files.
      - For use when running plugins on manually edited files.
      - Not needed in general use.
      - All files from the source folder will be copied into the extension.
      - Defaults to None
    * allow_path_error
      - Bool, if True and the x4 or user folder path looks wrong, the
        customizer will still attempt to run (with a warning).
      - Defaults to False
      
    Input:
    * prefer_single_files
      - Bool, if True then loose files will be used before those in cat/dat
        files, otherwise cat/dat takes precedence.
      - Only applies within a single search location, eg. within an
        extension, within the source folder, or within the base X4 folder;
        a loose file in the source folder will still be used over those
        in the X4 folder regardless of setting.
      - Defaults to False
    * ignore_extensions
      - Bool, if True then all extensions will be ignored, and files are
        only sourced from the source_folder or x4_folder.
      - Defaults to False
    * extension_whitelist
      - String, optional, semicolon separated list of lowercase extension
        folder names to consider loading (if found and enabled).
      - If not given, all extension folders are checked, except those in
        the blacklist.
    * extension_blacklist
      - String, optional, semicolon separated list of lowercase extension
        folder names to always ignore.
    * allow_cat_md5_errors
      - Bool, if True then when files extracted from cat/dat fail
        to verify their md5 hash, no exception will be thrown.
      - Defaults to False; consider setting True if needing to
        unpack incorrectly assembled catalogs.
    * ignore_output_extension
      - Bool, if True, the target extension being generated will have
        its prior content ignored (this run works on the original files,
        and not those changes made last run).
      - Defaults to True; should only be set False if not running
        transforms and wanting to analyse prior output.
    * X4_exe_name
      - String, name of the X4.exe file, to be used when sourcing the file
        for any exe transforms (if used), assumed to be in the x4 folder.
      - Defaults to "X4.exe", but may be useful to change based on the
        source exe file for transforms, eg. "X4_nonsteam.exe",
        "X4_steam.exe", or similar.
      - Note: the modified exe is written to the x4 folder with a ".mod.exe"
        extension, and will not be removed on subsequent runs even
        if they do not select any exe editing transforms. If wanting this
        to work with steam, then the X4.exe may need to be replaced with
        this modified exe manually.

    Output:
    * extension_name
      - String, name of the extension being generated.
      - Spaces will be replaced with underscores for the extension id.
      - A lowercase version of this will be used for the output folder
        name.
      - Defaults to 'x4_customizer'
    * output_to_user_extensions
      - Bool, if True then the generated extension holding output files
        will be under <path_to_user_folder/extensions>.
      - Warning: any prior output on the original path will still exist,
        and is not cleaned out automatically at the time of this note.
      - Defaults to False, writing to <path_to_x4_folder/extensions>
    * path_to_output_folder
      - Optional, Path to the location to write the extension files to,
        instead of the usual X4 or user documents extensions folders.
      - This is the parent directory to the extension_name folder.
    * output_to_catalog
      - Bool, if True then the modified files will be written to a single
        cat/dat pair, otherwise they are written as loose files.
      - Defaults to False
    * generate_sigs
      - Bool, if True then dummy signature files will be created.
      - Defaults to True.
    * make_maximal_diffs
      - Bool, if True then generated xml diff patches will do the
        maximum full tree replacement instead of using the algorithm
        to find and patch only edited nodes.
      - Turn on to more easily view xml changes.
      - Defaults to False.
    * forced_xpath_attributes
      - String, optional comma separate list of XML node attributes which,
        if found when constructing xpaths for output diffs, will be
        included in the xpath regardless of if they are needed.
      - Example: "id,name" will always include "id" and "name" attributes
        of elements in the xpath.
      - Also supports child node or attributes referenced using a relative
        xpath. Example: "parts/part/uv_animations/uv_animation" to require
        a uv_animation great-great-grandchild element, or
        "component/@ref" to include the "ref" attribute of a "component"
        child.
      - Can be used to make xpaths more specific, and more likely to break
        if an unknown extension is applied before the output extension
        (eg. when the customizer output is distributed to other users).
      - Can also be used in cases where a partial xpath matches multiple
        nodes, to clarify a child/attribute check instead of falling back
        on indexing.
    * shorten_xpaths
      - Bool, if True then xpaths will be shortened using "//" syntax,
        at the cost of possibly matching unwanted nodes if the diff
        patch is applied to a modified source file.
      - Only attempts to use // for the xpath prefix currently.
      - May result in measurably longer x4 loading times if used often
        in large files.
    * root_file_tag
      - String, extra tag added to names of modified files in the root folder
        and not placed in an extension, eg. X4.exe, to avoid overwriting the 
        originals.
      - Defaults to ".mod", eg. "X4.mod.exe".

    Logging:
    * live_editor_log_file_name
      - String, name a json file which the live editor (tracking hand
        edits in the gui) will save patches to, and reload from.
      - Patches will capture any hand edits made by the user.
      - File is located in the output extension folder.
      - Defaults to 'live_editor_log.json'
    * plugin_log_file_name
      - String, name of a text file to write plugin output messages to;
        content depends on plugins run.
      - File is located in the output extension folder.
      - Defaults to 'plugin_log.txt'
    * customizer_log_file_name
      - String, name a json file to write customizer log information to,
        including a list of files written, information that will be loaded
        on the next run to guide the file handling logic.
      - File is located in the output extension folder.
      - Defaults to 'customizer_log.json'
    * log_source_paths
      - Bool, if True then the path for any source files read will be
        printed in the plugin log.
      - Defaults to False
    * verbose
      - Bool, if True some extra status messages may be printed to the
        console.
      - Defaults to True

    Behavior:
    * show_tab_close_button
      - Bool, if True then a gui tab close button will be shown.
    * disable_cleanup_and_writeback
      - Bool, if True then cleanup from a prior run and any final
        writes will be skipped.
      - For use when testing plugins without modifying files.
      - Defaults to False
    * skip_all_plugins
      - Bool, if True all plugins will be skipped.
      - For use during cleaning mode.
      - Defaults to False
    * developer
      - Bool, if True then enable some behavior meant just for development,
        such as leaving exceptions uncaught.
      - Defaults to False
    * profile
      - Bool, if True then some extra profiling of customizer operations
        is performed, and times printed. For use during development.
      - Defaults to False.
    * disable_threading
      - Bool, if True then threads will not be used in the gui to
        call scripts and plugins. Will cause the gui to lock up
        during processing.
      - Intended for development use, to enable breakpoints during calls.
      - Defaults to False
    * use_scipy_for_scaling_equations
      - Bool, if True then scipy will be used to optimize scaling
        equations, for smoother curves between the boundaries.
      - If False or scipy is not found, then a simple linear scaling
        will be used instead.
      - May be unused currently.
      - Defaults to True
    * show_scaling_plots
      - Bool, if True and matplotlib and numpy are available, any
        generated scaling equations will be plotted (and their
        x and y vectors printed for reference). Close the plot window
        manually to continue plugin processing.
      - Primarily for development use.
      - May be unused currently.
      - Defaults to False

    * generate_content_xml
      - Bool, when True a new content.xml will be generated for the

      - Set False if wishing to reuse a custom content.xml, eg. one with
        custom description. The existing file may be modified to
