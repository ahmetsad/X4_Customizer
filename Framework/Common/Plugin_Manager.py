Decorator function for plugins.

    This is implemented as a two-stage decorator, the outer one handling
    the file check, the inner one returning the function.

    Eg. decorators have one implicit input argument, the following object,
    such that "@dec func" is like "dec(func)".

    To support input args, a two-stage decorator is used, such that
    "@dec(args) func" becomes "dec(args)(func)", where the decorator
    will return a nested decorator after handling args, and the nested
    decorator will accept the function as its arg.

    To get the wrapped function's name and documentation preserved,
    use the 'wraps' decorator from functools.

    Wrapper function for plugins.

    * plugin_type
      - String, type of this plugin.
      - Currently one of ['Analysis','Transform','Utility'].
    * category
      - String, category of the plugin; if not given, category
        is set to the name of the containing module.
      - Subpackages of plugins should set this explicitly.
    * uses_paths_from_settings
      - Bool, if True (default) then the Settings module will be
        undergo delayed init automatically to check paths and 
        setup the output folder for logging.
      - Not required if a plugin doesn't use any paths from Settings,
        and does not try to write to a log.
    * doc_priority
      - Int, indicates how early in documentation this should
        be printed relative to other plugins of the same type
        and category.
      - Defaults 0; positive numbers print earlier.
      - At the same priority, plugins print in alphabetical order.
    * shared_docs
      - List of strings, shared documentation text that is also used by other
        plugins in this category.
      - Printouts will aim to print this once when listing multiple
        plugins with the same shared_doc, or per-plugin when they
        are printed individually.

'''
To let transforms share some documentation, support can be added
to specifying categorized docstrings that will be printed at
the head of each documentation section.

Since modules can be spread out, and the doc generator doesn't know
where transforms came from, perhaps the docs should be wrapped into
some sort of object that gets imported upward to the Transforms package.
However, this has some clumsiness since the object would need
to be named, although the name is fluff.

Some ideas:

    @Plugin_Doc(category)
    def somename():
        'doc stuff'

    somename = Plugin_Doc(category, 'doc stuff')

    'doc stuff' (at top of module)
    somename = Plugin_Doc(category, __doc__)

To avoid "somename" fluff, could potentially stick the documentation
in the module or package __doc__, then annotate all transforms
automatically to grab that docstring (through the wrapper), adding
some term to the docstring to indicate it is for printout.

    'doc stuff' (at top of module)
    @Transform_Wrapper(category, ).
    ...
        func.category = ...
        module_doc = globals()['__doc__']
        func.category_doc = module_doc if 'tag' in module_doc else ''

Another approach might be to use a reserved plugin name, and capture
shared documentation in that plugin (that is otherwise uncallable
in some way), which has the advantage of plugin categorization
keeping it combined with others in its category.

    @Transform_Wrapper()
    def Documentation():
        'doc stuff'
        
    This will be a little clumsy with name conflicts as the plugins
    get * imported from multiple places, though, so won't really work out.
    Can put the category in the name, maybe.
    
    @Transform_Wrapper()
    def Weapon_Documentation():
        'doc stuff'

    Uniquifies the documentation during imports. The name is still
    a little fluffy, but serves a purpose. Transform category would
    be filled in like other transforms (from module or package name).
    The doc generator only needs a special handler to sort this
    plugin first when printing; otherwise it gets categorized along
    with what it is documenting automatically
    Can handle sorting with a special transform wrapper arg that
    indicates preferred sorting priority.
