    * category_objects_dict
      - Dict of dicts, holding every created Edit_Object.
      - Outer key is supported category name ('weapons','bullets', etc.),
        inner key is the object name.
    * category_objects_builders
      - Dict, keyed by supported object category name, holding the
        iterable functions which will create the objects.
    * tree_view_dict
      - Dict holding Edit_Tree_View objects, keyed by their name.
      - Note: this is replacing table groups, in general.
        TODO: delete table groups once fully converted.
    * tree_view_builders
      - Dict, keyed by supported tree_view name, holding the
        functions which will build the trees.
      - Used to autobuild tree views when a view is requested that
        isn't available.
      - Other modules should register their builder functions with
        the Live_Editor at their import time, so that the editor
        does not need to know about them when importing this module.
    * patches_key_dict
      - Dict holding patch values, loaded from a prior run or
        updated with current changes.
      - Key is taken from item keys, eg. (name, virtual_path, xpath, attribute),
        formed this way to make json save/load easier.
      - To be checked and applied whenever an Edit_Object is added,
        and updated before writing out to json.
    * patches_node_id_dict
      - As above, except keyed by an alternate combination of attributes
        that includes the xml node id.
      - This is only set up as json loading, and used as a backup match
        for new items.
      - During runtime, this dict may get out of date (holding deleted
        patches and similar), but any such discrepencies should be
        harmless as long as the patches_key_dict is checked first.

Thoughts on how to deal with patch key changes across versions:

    The basic idea: between customizer versions, either an
    xpath or field name may change in the item macros,
    which will break directly patch key matching.

    Option 1)
        Since the keys have both a local field name and an xpath,
        along with the virtual path and attribute name, they can potentially
        check alternate versions of the keys: 
            (field,virtual,attr)
            (virtual,xpath,attr)
        When doing this, an alternate match found should update the patch
        in question, so that it doesn't carry old version cruft into
        future versions.

        To carry this out somewhat efficiently (not rebuilding the alt
        keys every time), the alt keys would need to be generated per
        patch as well as per item, and then cross checked.

    Option 2)
        Since xpaths should always find the same node for the
        item and the patch of that item, this could instead
        do a sample xml node lookup for each patch, and compare against
        the node(s) referenced by the item when it was intialized.
        When nodes match, the item can be patched, and the patch itself
        updated with the item key.

        This approach would be the most robust, since field name and
        xpath can be tweaked in the item macros without worrying out
        patches getting too out of sync.

        However, this approach has higher overhead, paying the
        full patch application penalty (almost) for xpath lookups,
        though this should be relatively small compared to the items
        being loaded (which check 3 versions of all fields, whereas
        most items will not be patched and the patch only checks
        one version).

        Regarding xml node version, patches are applied to the 'edited'
        item value, which in turn starts as a copy of the 'patched'
        item value, so this can compare based on the 'patched' xml.
        Note that this is different than when patches are properly
        applied to xml, using the 'current' version (same as 'patched'
        up until transforms are run).
        TODO: revisit this when pre-edit transform support is added,
        since the source xml will be some special version.

        Side note: the element objects returned by xpath checks can
        change location across xpath evaluations; reuse the node
        ids added to element tags for diff generation support.
