class Edit_Object:
    '''
    An object represented by a collection of Edit_Items and Display_Items,
    or references to other attached Edit_Objects.
    Objects of different types should subclass this to fill in
    their own initialization code.
    This could source from one xml file, a piece of an xml file, or
    multiple xml files, depending on what is represented.

    Attributes:
    * parent
      - Live_Editor holding this object.
    * name
      - String, name for this object, generally taken from game
        files in some way ('id' or 'name' attribute of some node).
    * category
      - String, category of this object as used in the Live_Editor.
    * items_dict
      - Dict, keyed by arbitrary item name (eg. 'dps'), holding
        Edit_Item and Display_Item objects belonging to this object.
    * item_version_object_refs
      - Dict, keyed by item name, then keyed by version, holding
        the Edit_Object the item references (or None if not found).
    * category_item_name_list
      - List of strings, item names in preferred display order for
        this category of objects.
      - This should always match for objects of the same category, 
        even if one or both of them do not having matching items.
