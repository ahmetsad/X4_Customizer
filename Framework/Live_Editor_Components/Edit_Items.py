class _Base_Item:
    '''
    Base class for Edit_Item and Display_Item objects, representing
    an attribute of an xml node in some file, or else a computation
    for display.

    Attributes:
    * parent
      - The Edit_Object this item belongs to, in case it needs to
        do any reverse access.
    * name
      - String, internal name of the item.
    * display_name
      - Optional string, name to be used during display in the gui or a file.
    * description
      - Optional string, descriptive text for this item.
    * version_value_dict
      - Dict of values, keyed by version.
      - Versions include: ['vanilla','patched','current','edited']
      - These are computed and buffered here.
      - Only 'edited' will be editable; the others are read-only and
        meant for display.
      - The 'patched' copy is after other (non-customizer) extensions have
        been applied.
      - The 'current' copy is after a customizer script has run, possibly
        performing additional edits after the live changes.
      - Use Reset_Value() to clear a value if its dependencies have changed.
    * read_only
      - Bool, if True then edits of this item should be disallowed.
      - May be used for object references or similar, until those
        have support added.
      - Defaults True on Display_Items, False on Edit_Items.
    * widget
      - Qt Widget with a setText method that is attached to
        the edited version of this item.
      - TODO: remove once switch to q_item_group is complete.
    * q_item_group
      - Q_Item_Group that points at this item, potentially
        holding multiple Q_Edit_Item and updating them all at once.
    * version_dependents
      - Dict, keye by version, with lists of Display_Item objects
        that depend on this item.
      - When this item is edited or reset, dependents will be
        reset automatically.
      - These should be filled in by the other items when they
        are set up with dependencies.
      - Note: avoid circular dependencies, as they might cause lockup.
      - To be filled in by the owner Edit_Object.
    * hidden
      - Bool, if True then this item should not be displayed.

    Container for a single editable item, eg. one field in the xml.
    Initializor takes paths to the field, and fills in values automatically.

    Init parameters:
    * game_file
      - The Game_File object that holds the item being edited, in
        its various versions, to be used for the initial init.
      - This may be from a multiprocessing copy, and will not be
        kept in case it gets out of sync with transformed xml
        state.

    New attributes:
    * virtual_path
      - Path for the game file being edited.
    * xpath
      - Full xpath to the node being edited, relative to the file root.
      - Note: the attribute does not have to exist in the node prior
        to editing, for cases where an attribute will be added.
    * attribute
      - Node attribute being edited.
    * key
      - String made from a "name,virtual_path,xpath,attribute", used as
        a way to identify this item uniquely but generically, for saving
        patches and elsewhere applyling them to xml.
      - For safety across versions, there is some slight redundancy
        between name and the other fields, but this can allow either
        name or another field to change and the correct item to
        still be identified. This is pending further development
        at this time.
    * is_reference
      - Bool, if True then the value of this item indicates a reference
        to some other object, eg. is a bullet name.
      - Will trigger a reference object update in the parent object
        when this value is changed.
    * xml_node_id
      - String, the id of an xml element that the patched version of this
        item was initialized from.
      - Used to aid in matching to live editor patches from a prior run.
