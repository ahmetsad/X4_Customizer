# Binary patching support, brought over from X3 Customizer.
# Originally this was for obj files, but naming is tweaked for general binary.

class Binary_Patch:
    '''
    Patch to apply to a binary file.

    Attributes:
    * file
      - String, name of the binary file being edited.
    * ref_code
      - String, the code starting at the offset which is being replaced.
      - Used for verification and for offset searching.
      - Use '.' for any wildcard match.
      - Spaces allowed for visual alignment; ignored during parsing.
      - Will be converted to a regex pattern, though the string should
        not be formatted as a regex pattern.
    * new_code
      - Byte string, the replacement code.
      - Length of this doesn't need to match ref_code.
      - Replacements will be on a 1:1 basis with existing bytes, starting
        at a matched offset and continuing until the end of the new_code.
      - Overall binary code will remain the same length.
      - Spaces allowed, as with ref_code.
      - Also supports byte deletions and insertions, to aid in moving
        code sections.  A '-' removes 1 byte, a '+' inserts one byte
        with a default 0 value.  Replacements continue after deletions
        points, and overwrite insertion points, eg. '++0607' will insert
        two bytes of values '0607'. The number of '-' and '+' must
        always match.
    * expected_matches
      - List of ints, number of places in code a match should be found.
      - May give multiple values that are considered a success, eg.
        [0,1,2] for 0, 1, or 2 matches.
      - May be initialized from an int.
      - Normally 1, but may be more in some cases of repeated code that
        should all be patched the same way.
