def Rescale_Ship_Speeds(
        *scaling_rules
    ):
    '''
    Rescales the speeds of different ship classes, centering on the give
    target average speeds. Ships are assumed to be using their fastest race
    engines. Averaged across all ships of the rule match.

    Cargo capacity of traders and miners is adjusted to compensate for
    speed changes, so they move a similar amount of wares. If multiple
    ships use the same cargo macro, it is adjusted by an average of
    their speed adjustments.
    
    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching
    rules are applied in order, with a ship being grouped by the first
    rule it matches:

    * average
      - Float, the new average speed to adjust to.
      - If None, keeps the original average.
    * variation
      - Float, less than 1, how much ship speeds are allowed to
        differ from the average relative to the average.
      - If None, keeps the original variation.
      - If original variation is less than this, it will not be changed.
      - Only applies strictly to 90% of ships; up to 10% are treated as
        outliers, and will have their speed scaled similarly but will be
        outside this band.
      - Eg. 0.5 means 90% of ships will be within +/- 50% of
        their group average speed.
    * match_any
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is included,
        if not part of match_none.
    * match_all
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching all of these is included,
        if not part of match_none.
    * match_none
      - List of matching rules. Any ship matching any of these is excluded.
    * use_arg_engine
      - Bool, if True then Argon engines will be assumed for all ships
        instead of their faction engines.
    * use_split_engine
      - Bool, if True then Split engines will be assumed.
      - This will tend to give high estimates for ship speeds, eg. mk4 engines.
    * skip
      - Optional, bool, if True then this group is not edited.
      - Can be used in early matching rules to remove ships from all later
        matching rules.
        
    Example:
    ```
    Rescale_Ship_Speeds(
        {'match_any' : ['name ship_spl_xl_battleship_01_a_macro'], 'skip' : True},
        {'match_all' : ['type  scout' ],  'average' : 500, 'variation' : 0.2},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_s'],  'average' : 400, 'variation' : 0.5},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_m'],  'average' : 300, 'variation' : 0.5},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_l'],  'average' : 200, 'variation' : 0.5},
        {'match_all' : ['class ship_xl'], 'average' : 150, 'variation' : 0.5})
    ```
    '''
    '''
    Note:
    Vanilla ship speeds have these approximate averages (race engines):
    xs: 130 (58 to 152)
    s : 328 (71 to 612)
    m : 319 (75 to 998)
    l : 146 (46 to 417)
    xl: 102 (55 to 164)

    Split ships exaggerate the high end, eg. alligator(gas) hitting 998.
    The xs includes boarding pods (29 speed), drones, mass traffic.
