'''
Note: due to sluggish performance, the highlighter will be broken
up into a Qt element and the regex processing block. The regex part
should be independent and safe to run in a thread, and will return
a list of highlighting rules to feed into the qt block in the
main thread.

Performance notes:
    For a t file, original processing with QRegExp style
    inside the class (like done with scripts) took around 8-9 seconds.

    Switching to Get_Highlight_Macros and the re module drops this to
    6.5 seconds, where the class highlightBlock calls the function
    on each line.
    
    Preprocessing the lines drops highlighting from 6.5 to 1.7 seconds.
    Doing so in a single side thread takes 4.5 seconds, which drops
    down to 2.5 seconds when using multiprocessing.

    Overall, preprocessing drops it to 4.2 seconds. Not quite satisfactory,
    but at least the gui lockup period is only 1.7.
    For comparison, notepad++ loading the file takes ~1.2 seconds.
