class VFS_Item:
    '''
    Represents a VFS folder or file.
    To be a little lighter weight, nested files will sometimes be tracked
    by name, while only nested folders are consistently tracked as VFS_Items.

    Attributes:
    * virtual_path
      - String, path to this folder.
    * parent_path
      - String, virtual_path of the parent folder.
    * parent
      - VFS_Item representing the parent folder.
      - None for the top level.
    * name
      - String, name of this folder or file.
      - At the top level, this is just 'root'.
    * folders
      - List of VFS_Item objects that are folders under this one.
      - Empty if this is a file.
    * files
      - List of VFS_Item objects that are files under this one.
      - Empty if this is a file.
    * file_paths
      - List of strings, virtual_paths of files that are at this folder level.
      - Empty if this is a file.
    * is_folder
      - Bool, True if this is a folder, else it is a file.
    * shared_file_info_dict
      - Dict present in the parent window, keyed by virtual_paths,
        holding some parsed file information.
      - This should be the same for all vfs items, and will be passed
        to generated children, to be used in coloring and similar checks.
      - This dict link is ensured never to change, though the contents
        may be swapped around (eg. nested dicts could be removed and
        remade).
    * window
      - The gui window holding this item. Used for Print lookup.
