    Thread launcher, which will run a script or specific plugin
    or other function.
    This hooks into the framework Print function, plus threads may
    modify customizer state, so only one thread should be active at a time.

    Note: this will handle its own 'finished' signals; requesters
    should not listen in, and instead provide a callback function
    that this will call appropriately when their work finishes.

    TODO: think about safety of wigets accessing minor customizer state
    while threads are running.
    Note: this will queue up work requests, and launches threads either
    when a work request arrives and no thread is running, or when
    a thread completes and there are queued items.

    Attributes:
    * window
      - The main window.
    * request_queue
      - List of Work_Request objects.
      - These will be serviced serially, in arrival order.
    * current_request
      - Work_Request to be handled on an immediately upcoming thread
        launch, or that of the currently active thread or last finished
        thread.
    * return_value
      - Whatever was returned from the function call is stored here.
    * thread_active
      - Bool, True when a thread has been set up to launch, or has
        completed. This is set in the main domain, and used to
        regulate queue service.

    Signals:
    * send_message
      - Emitted when send text to print, with the text as the arg,
        during a thread run.
      - To be listened to by the main window for Print calls,
        and used to cross thread domains.
