    '''
    Tree view of the table entries, by name and possibly categorized.
    Clicking a plugin will signal a separate documentation
    window to display info (field names and data values).
    TODO: move some of this logic up to the tab page widget.

    Attributes:
    * widget_item_info
      - QGroupBox widget that will display the item info.
      - Should be set up by the parent after initial init.
    * last_selected_item_label
      - Text name of the last selected item.
      - Unlike the built-in QTreeWidget version, this will only hold
        active items, not table headers.
    * last_selected_item
      - The last selected item itself, associated with last_selected_item_label.
    * item_dict
      - Dict, keyed by label, of QTreeWidgetItem leaf nodes.
      - Used to get an item from last_selected_item_label.
      - Note: this could be unsafe if a label is used more than once,
        so avoid using it for anything critical; currently it is just
        used to restore item selection after a tree rebuild.
      - TODO: maybe set this to track through nested nodes, by joining
        labels together.
    * branch_dict
      - Dict, keyed by label, holding QTreeWidgetItem branch nodes.
