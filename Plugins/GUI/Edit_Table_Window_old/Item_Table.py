    Attributes:

      - Edited:
        - QLineEdit boxes, generally allowing user input when associated
          with items that aren't read_only.
      - Vanilla, patched, current:
        - QLineEdit read_only boxes displaying static information.
      - Each list will be the same length, and will grow to the maximum
        amount needed at any display update.

        the column, False to hide it.
