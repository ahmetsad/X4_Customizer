Notes on font/stylesheet headaches:

    - It seems that this widget only inherits font when created
      if it has a non-empty style sheet applied; later setFont calls
      to the parent don't reach the children.

    - Conditional styles (QLineEdit[readonly = "1"]{...}) do not seem
      to work; maybe examples are out of date.
      Or maybe this is nonfunctional for dynamic changes, and only
      works at init (though examples imply it working at runtime).
      Docs suggest removing and reapplying the stylesheet on
      a Qt property change.
      However, these still mess up the fonts even when not working as wanted.

    - Can maybe try psuedo states for ":read-only", though highlighting
      edited boxes won't work out so well.

    - Readonly items seem to somewhat preserve their starting font.
    - Modified items do not, even when also just changing background color.

    - Initial 'styleSheet()' is a blank string.
    - Setting a blank style sheet doesn't cause problems.

    - When just using the modified highlight, the very first
      setStyleSheet did not change the font, but removing the
      style (setStyleSheet('')) did.
      Packing the empty sheet in "QLineEdit{}" did not matter.

    - Maybe some fluff stylesheet term can help, acting as a placeholder
      so that an empty string is never used?
      - Didn't help.

    - Maybe ensure style properties are never removed.
      - Didn't help.

    - Spam clicking on cells also causes other oddities, like readonly
      cells with no item getting highlighted as modified somehow.

    - Maybe set styles to have two alternate versions, which both
      set the same fields?
      - Didn't help.

    - Supposition: whenever a widget has a stylesheet set that is not
      blank, some internal piping gets broken and the widget can no
      longer inherit font properly on later calls.
      Hard to see how this could be intentional, so consider a qt bug.  

    - Maybe look into palletes? or setBackgroundRole or similar?

      Success!  finally...
